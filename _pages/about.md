I am a health economist and a postdoctoral research fellow at the Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics (CHOICE) Institute at University of Washington.

My research integrates the analytical frameworks of economics, health services research, and social determinants of health to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of health care and medical decision making. I focus on identifying causal relationships using large-scale health care data, with a particular emphasis on areas such as mental health services, aging, informal caregiving, and vulnerable populations. 

I completed my PhD in Health Economics at University of Washington in 2023.

I am <ins>on the job market</ins> in the 2024-2025 academic year. Here is my [CV](CV_DLee.pdf).
