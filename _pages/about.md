I am a health economist and a postdoctoral researcher at the CHOICE Institute, University of Washington.

My research combines the analytical frameworks of economics, health services research, and social determinants of health to deepen our understanding of the causes and consequences of health care decision-making. In particular, I focus on identifying causal relationships by leveraging large-scale health care data around the topics, such as mental heatlh and aging. 

I completed my PhD in Health Economics at the University of Washington in 2023.

Here is my [CV](CV_DLee.pdf).
