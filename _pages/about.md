I am a health economist and a postdoctoral researcher at the CHOICE Institute, University of Washington.

My research integrates the analytical frameworks of economics, health services research, and social determinants of health to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of health care decision-making. Specifically, I focus on identifying causal relationships by utilizing large-scale health care data, with a particular emphasis on topics such as mental health and psychiatric care and aging.

I completed my PhD in Health Economics at the University of Washington in 2023.

Here is my [CV](CV_DLee.pdf).
