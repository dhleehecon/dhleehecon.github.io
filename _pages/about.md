I am a health economist and a postdoctoral research fellow at the Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics (CHOICE) Institute at University of Washington.

My research combines the analytical frameworks of economics, health services research, and social determinants of health to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of healthcare and medical decision making. I have a strong interest in studying topics related to mental health services, aging, informal caregiving, and vulnerable populations. 

I completed my PhD in Health Economics at University of Washington in 2023.

I am <ins>on the job market</ins> in the 2024-2025 academic year. Here is my [CV](CV_DLee.pdf).
