I am a health economist and a postdoctoral research fellow in the Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics (CHOICE) Institute at University of Washington.

My research combines the analytical frameworks of economics, health services research, and social determinants of health to address complex health policy challenges. I am particularly interested in studying topics related to Medicare, mental health, aging, and vulnerable populations. 

I received my PhD in Health Economics from University of Washington in 2023. 

For more information, please see my CV [here](CV_DLee.pdf).

I am <ins>on the job market</ins> in the 2024-2025 academic year.
