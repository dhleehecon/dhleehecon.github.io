I am a health economist and a postdoctoral researcher at the CHOICE Institute, University of Washington.

My research integrates the analytical frameworks of economics, health services research, and social determinants of health to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of health care decision-making. I focus on identifying causal relationships using large-scale health care data, with a particular emphasis on areas such as mental health care, aging, and informal caregiving.

I completed my PhD in Health Economics at the University of Washington in 2023.

I am on the job market<ins>text</ins> in the 2024-2025 academic year. Here is my [CV](CV_DLee.pdf).
