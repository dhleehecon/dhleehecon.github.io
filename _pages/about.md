I am a health economist and a postdoctoral research fellow in the Division of Geriatric Medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

My research applies the analytical frameworks of economics and health services research to examine the health and economic well-being of older adults and their family caregivers, with a particular focus on mental health and dementia. My first-authored publications have appeared in leading health economics and policy journals, including *Journal of Health Economics, Health Economics,* and *Health Affairs*. 

I received a PhD in Health Economics from the University of Washington and an MSc in Health Policy from the London School of Economics.
