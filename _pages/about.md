I am a health economist and a postdoctoral researcher at the CHOICE Institute, University of Washington.

My research integrates the analytical frameworks of economics, health services research, and social determinants of health to deepen our understanding of the causes and consequences of health care decision-making. In particular, I focus on identifying causal relationships by leveraging large-scale health care data and applying advanced econometrics methods in innovative ways.

I received my Ph.D. in Health Services Research (Health Economics) from University of Washington in 2023.
